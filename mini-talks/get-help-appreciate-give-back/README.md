# Get Help, Appreciate, Give Back

## What is free software

> Free software is software that gives you the user the freedom to share, study and modify it. We call this free software because the user is free. - [Free Software Foundation](https://www.fsf.org/about/what-is-free-software)

### Free Software Foundation

> The free software movement was started in 1983 by computer scientist [Richard M. Stallman](https://www.stallman.org), when he launched a project called GNU, which stands for “GNU is Not UNIX”, to provide a replacement for the UNIX operating system—a replacement that would respect the freedoms of those using it.

## A small history lesson

> [Richard Matthew Stallman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman) (/ˈstɔːlmən/; born March 16, 1953), often known by his initials, rms,[1] (also his email ID), and occasionally upper-case RMS, is an American free software movement activist and programmer. He campaigns for software to be distributed in a manner such that its users receive the freedoms to use, study, distribute, and modify that software. Software that ensures these freedoms is termed free software. Stallman launched the GNU Project, founded the Free Software Foundation, developed the GNU Compiler Collection and GNU Emacs, and wrote the GNU General Public License. - Wikipedia

## Role of open-source in today’s software development

Most of our applications that are live in production are based on free-software.

There are tools that we use at work, quite a lot of them are free software.

## Who writes open-source software and why? (2/3)

Some people do that as a part of their primary job, but otherwise,

[Why do programmers write open-source software?](https://www.linux.com/news/why-do-programmers-write-open-source-software)

> Another big motivation for open source programming is someone saying, "I want a program that does ____," and either one doesn't exist or it is too expensive for him to buy, so he decides to write his own -- and asks other people who want a similar program to help out.

## Appreciating open-source

How I (used to) do it:

- Staring libraries on [NPM](https://npmjs.com)
- Staring projects on [GitHub](https://github.com)
- Using badges on your projects - example: [Grunt.js badge](https://gruntjs.com/built-with-grunt-badge)

## Giving back

- Helping them with documentation
- Reporting bugs
- Fixing bugs
- Helping them financially - example: [donations to webpack](https://webpack.js.org)
- Interesting idea - [I will now charge my clients a fee to support open source projects - Manuel Bieh](https://dev.to/manuelbieh/i-will-now-charge-my-clients-a-fee-to-support-open-source-projects-277)
- Write new open-source software and complete the chain

## A few examples of my contributions
