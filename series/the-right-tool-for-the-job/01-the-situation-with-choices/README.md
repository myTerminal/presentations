# The Right Tool For The Job: The Situation With Choices

![Choices, Choices Everywhere](assets/choices-everywhere.jpg)

## The tree(s) of choices

[Implementation Choices on coggle.it](https://coggle.it/diagram/Xzi7DZkqogOWM_xm/t/implementation-choices-question)

## Furthermore to the mind-map

- These questions are not all of the ones that we encounter while choosing tools for a typical software solution
- The tree keeps growing as we speak with more choices being added every week

## What is not included in the mini-map

We didn't talk about choices for -

- Hardware tools
- The tools used, example: text-editors, web-browsers, terminal emulators, etc.
- Coding-standards and style including spaces-vs-tabs, file encoding, line-endings, etc.

## A few observations

- Like life, almost every software implementation comes with choices
- Not a single choice is bad/useless/unworthy
- Not a single choice is "the best"
- An implementation can comprise of more than a single choices at once in combination
- It is not possible for a normal developer/engineer to be fully well-versed with all the leaves in the tree

## Thoughts on solving the problem

![A branch with leaves](assets/tree-branch-leaves.png)

- We create software and not the other way around
- One should never limit themselves to a single leaf on a branch but should be open to options
- A leaf is "best" just for the current problem at hand, and only with complete understanding of the problem
- The tree should grow more leaves regularly, dropping a few if necessary
- Choices from the past can be re-evaluated keeping the new leaves in picture and implementations should adapt if necessary

## Coming soon

We'll dive deeper down the tree starting from the root and talk about a few strategies to help us choose the right leaf/leaves for a particular implementation.
