# The Right Tool For The Job: The Situation With Choices

![Choices, Choices Everywhere](assets/choices-everywhere.jpg)

## The tree(s) of choices

[Implementation Choices on coggle.it](https://coggle.it/diagram/Xzi7DZkqogOWM_xm/t/implementation-choices-question)

## Furthermore to the mind-map

- These questions are not all of the ones that we encounter while choosing tools for a typical software solution
- The tree keeps growing as we speak with more choices being added every week

## What is not included in the mini-map

- Choices for hardware tools
- Choices for the tools used, ex: text-editors, web-browsers, terminal emulators, etc.
- Choices for coding-standards, style, and other such preferences

## A few observations

- Almost everything you want to achieve has choices associated with it
- Not a single choice is bad/useless/unworthy
- Not a single choice is "the best"
- An implementation can comprise of two choices at once in combination
- It is not possible for a normal developer/engineer to be fully well-versed with all the leaves in the tree

## How to solve the problem?

- We are supposed to make software and not the other way around
- Never be limited to one leaf in a node but be open to options
- "The right" leaf should be decided just for the problem at hand, only after understanding the problem entirely
- Regularly make sure more leaves keep growing
- Re-evaluate the choices we make and adapt if required/suitable

## Coming soon

We'll dive deeper down the three starting from the root and talk about a few strategies to choose the right leaf/leaves for a particular implementation.
